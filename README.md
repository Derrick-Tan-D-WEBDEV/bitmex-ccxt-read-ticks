# Reading Bitmex Markets (Using ccxt and Python)
![Example For Read Ticks](https://github.com/Derrick-Tan-D-WEBDEV/bitmex-ccxt-read-ticks-mysql/blob/main/read-ticks/bitmex-read-ticks-to-msql-example.gif?raw=true)
In this project, we will be using python to read the markets (symbol: XTZUSDTH21) and pump it to the mysql database.
The whole project will keep on looping unless the user used "keyboard interupt" to interupt the console!
Good luck and happy coding!🤗☕
## Attention⚠A note for you📒:
<ul>
  <li>Don't forget to change the database credentials in the script before you start!</li>
  <li>You can change your own symbol that you wanted in the script!</li>
  <li>Try to change the ASCII text that you wanted before the program start! It is fun!😁 </li>
</ul>
